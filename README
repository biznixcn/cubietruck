ABOUT
=====

Script(s)/configs to generate a SD Card Image containing a custom OS
which would run a Cubietruck :). Check out "support status" section
for what's working and what isn'nt.

MOTIVATION:
===========

I am building a NAS using ARM based board (Cubietruck/Cubieboard3).
Therefore I needed a custom kernel and custom rootfs packaged into 
a custom SD Card image. These usually requires a lot of commands to
type in and is time consuming. I wanted to reduce this as much and
focus on tweaking/building an images to suit the objectives of my
projects. This project aims to reduce repetitions to the bare minimun 
and get a predictable build in the process :)
