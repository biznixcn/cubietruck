ABOUT
=====

Script(s)/configs to generate a SD Card Image containing a custom OS
which would run a Cubietruck :). Check out image support status for
what's working and what isn'nt.

MOTIVATION:
===========

I am building a NAS using ARM based board (Cubietruck/Cubieboard3).
Therefore I needed a custom kernel and custom SD Card image. Those
usually take some time to tweak/build with a lot of repeated. This
project aims to reduce this repetition to the bare minimun and also
a way to have predictable build :)
